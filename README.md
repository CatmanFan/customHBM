# customHBM
Wii HOME Menu (HBM) library

Originally a fork of [libhomemenu](https://github.com/TheProjecter/libhomemenu) by TheProjecter, this is aiming to be a recode continuing from where the previous library left at the time its development became inactive. Like the original, it is intended to be graphics-library independent, however it may behave differently based on the graphics backend used (libwiisprite, GRRLIB, native, etc.).

It contains derived portions of code from the original libhomemenu (license unknown, original source code is attributed above) translated into C++, however the majority of code has been rewritten from scratch. The project also uses portions of code from [Tantric/dborth](https://github.com/dborth)'s [libwiigui](https://github.com/dborth/libwiigui) ([WiiBrew page](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Libwiigui)), which is licensed under GNU GPL, as well as derived code of [GRRLIB](https://github.com/GRRLIB/GRRLIB)'s (licensed under MIT) TTF drawing functions. I have chosen to license this project under GNU GPL as it is also the same license used in Tantric/dborth's software (Snes9XGX, FCEUGX, VBAGX, WiiMC, ...) as well as in [WiiSXRX](https://github.com/niuus/WiiSXRX) (as GPL-3.0) and [Not64](https://github.com/extremscorner/not64) (as GPL-2.0).

This library uses the original Nintendo Wii Menu sounds (ripped using Dolphin to account for the reverb filter) and fonts (designed by Fontworks). It also makes use of [PNGU](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/PNGU) for rendering the images included, and FreeTypeGX to render the aforementioned fonts.
